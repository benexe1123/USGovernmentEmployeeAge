USGovernmentEmployeeAge

R script which scrapes Wikipedia's lists of current US Senators, current US Representatives, and living US Presidents. Filters for those born before 1945 (the creation of the first electronic computer: the ENIAC), outputs each person who fits this creteria, and displays a count of those in each category (Senator, Representative, and President).
